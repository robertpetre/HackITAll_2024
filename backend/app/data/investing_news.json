The firm highlights DHT Holdings (NYSE:DHT), Frontline (NYSE:FRO), and International Seaways (NYSE:INSW) as top plays to benefit from potential tailwinds in the VLCC market.The latest sanctions bring the total number of VLCCs under restriction to 35, with an additional 85 vessels on a \"watchlist\" for potentially carrying Iranian oil. These 120 ships account for nearly 14% of the global fleet of 850 trading VLCCs, representing a substantial capacity risk if further enforcement escalates.Iran\u2019s crude exports have risen to 1.7 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2024, a sharp increase from 0.3 mb/d between 2019 and 2022, fueled by muted sanction enforcement and reliance on shadow fleets. Most of these exports head to China, pressuring other producers like Saudi Arabia, whose exports have declined to 6.0 mb/d in 2024 from 6.5 mb/d in 2023.Jefferies views the sanctions as a potential catalyst for the tanker market. Restricting Iran\u2019s shadow fleet could reduce VLCC availability while driving demand for sanctioned-free vessels to meet global crude transportation needs.

TikTok Shop serves as an e-commerce channel for major brands such as e.l.f. Cosmetics, Ninja Kitchen, among other products. TikTok Shop said in a press release in late November that its sales had reached $100 million on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, when bargain-hunting American consumers spent heavily online. Previously, it said the number of people purchasing goods on TikTok Shop each month had nearly tripled. Reuters could not independently verify its claims.A U.S. federal appeals court on Friday upheld a law requiring Chinese-based ByteDance to divest TikTok in the U.S. by early next year or face a ban. A ban of the popular short video app, if it happens, could extend to TikTok Shop, too.\"TikTok Shop is a new distribution channel and brands are doing really well on it,\" said Erik Huberman, CEO of marketing agency Hawke Media, which has clients that sell products through the feature. \"Honestly, there isn't an alternative. It will be a lost revenue stream.\" Like its rivals Shein and Temu, TikTok Shop showcases merchandise from third-party vendors, some which ship items from China, competing fiercely on price. Each of the platforms have tried to lure more U.S. sellers with lower fees to help with shipping speeds.  3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.Capitalizing on the popularity of the TikTok social media app, TikTok Shop merchants typically use ads and sponsored \"influencers\" to market their products to TikTok's 170 million U.S. users. Merchants on TikTok Shop fulfill shoppers' orders directly, sometimes using third-parties or TikTok's e-commerce fulfillment services. For shoppers like Jasmine Whaley, 31, of York, Pennsylvania, TikTok Shop has provided a new place to find clothes, skin care products and  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX). She's spent almost $700 on the platform this year after seeing videos from influencers and advertisers about merchandise. TikTok has \"cracked the code\" on curating content and products that she likes, Whaley said. Her TikTok Shop orders often are delivered to her more quickly than orders she places on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), she said.For merchants and influencers, TikTok Shop offers what it calls \"LIVE,\" live-video streams from which shoppers can purchase merchandise directly. Nico Le Bourgeois, head of U.S. Operations for TikTok Shop, said in a statement to Reuters that the number of Live sessions hosted monthly has nearly tripled over the past year in the U.S.According to third-party data firm Facteus, U.S. spending on TikTok Shop exceeded spending on Shein and Temu in the seven days leading up to Cyber Monday, Dec. 2, a heavy online shopping day. Facteus said its data comes from 140 million consumer debit and credit cards representing 7% to 10% of all U.S. spending.

Instead, the topic is expected to surface during bipartisan negotiations over tax reform, especially with the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in 2025.4) Also, the DOGE's ability to act as a \"CEO\" of the government is limited by legal and procedural constraints. \u201cTwo years will likely not be enough time to implement major changes, but where it can scrutinize is likely related to waste, fraud, and abuse of spending,\u201d analysts said.5) Lastly, the conversation addressed the topic of tariffs. While imposing a blanket tariff on all imported goods would necessitate a national security justification, which might be challenging to substantiate, the possibility of reinstating tariffs against China and Mexico was acknowledged as more likely to be considered. 3rd party Ad.

This approach appears to challenge the terms of an existing free-trade agreement.Regarding China, Trump unveiled plans for an \"additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs,\" though the implications remain unclear.He has previously vowed to revoke China's most-favored-nation trade status and impose tariffs exceeding 60% on Chinese imports, a level much higher than those seen during his first presidency.Is DBKGn truely undervalued?With DBKGn making headlines, investors are asking: Is it truly valued fairly?

Even with the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) managed to double its price for the second year in a row, it is very far from what looks like a bubble for tech companies.For instance, the Bitcoin (BTC) price macro chart looks too different from the \"Internet bubble\" of 1990s that registered zero years in red. Neither overhyped MicroStrategy journey in crypto should be treated as a signal of a \"bubble phase.\"Instead, Visser recalled 2020-2021 NFT and early meme coin frenzies as textbook examples of what bubbles might look in crypto. They were accompanied by euphorias in media and splendid performance of all classes of altcoin assets:As such, altcoin statistics of this cycle also confirm that we are very far from reaching the top. As covered by U.Today previously, the ETH/BTC rate, a crucial indicator for the altcoin segment, set a multi-year low in recent weeks right before the Bitcoin (BTC) jump over $100,000.Ethereum (ETH) was not so cheap against Bitcoin (BTC) since April 2021.

It is unclear whether Bitcoin has hit a temporary peak, though, as the asset may be finding it difficult to sustain its bullish momentum based on the current price action.The sharp red candle that follows the $100,000 test on the given chart indicates significant profit-taking by investors. This suggests that a lot of traders and holders took advantage of the chance to lock in profits, which led to selling pressure and kept Bitcoin from decisively breaking through the six-figure mark. Bitcoin is still above important support levels, such as $92,000, which could serve as a basis for additional upward movement in spite of this. Technically, Bitcoin is still trading above its upward-trending 50-100 and 200-day EMAs. Even in the case of brief market consolidation, this bullish alignment indicates that the overall upward trend is still in place. A slight overbought condition is also indicated by the RSI, suggesting that a cooldown may occur prior to any notable higher movements.Bitcoin must overcome the existing resistance levels and spark fresh buying interest in order to make a convincing break above $100,000. This will probably rely on a mix of improved macroeconomic circumstances, more institutional involvement and less profit-taking pressure to sell. It is impossible to completely rule out a short-term decline, but Bitcoin's future is still bright. As a store of value and inflation hedge, the cryptocurrency has proven resilient and is still gaining popularity. Holding $92,000 and $85,000 would bolster Bitcoin's case for another rally attempt, making them important support levels to keep an eye on. 3rd party Ad.

Even though the current rally is showing signs of strength, it is unclear if Ethereum can continue its upward trajectory given the lack of momentum beyond $4,000.Ethereum's gradual recovery over the past few weeks is depicted in the provided chart. The asset's ascent has a strong basis thanks to the bullish alignment of key moving averages such as the 50-day and 200-day EMAs.However, as Ethereum gets closer to $4,000, the volume profile points to a minor drop in buying interest, suggesting that traders may be hesitant at these prices. Ethereum is still in a strong position for future expansion in spite of this.Having maintained higher highs and higher lows \u2014 two hallmarks of a persistent bullish trend \u2014 the asset has effectively exited a protracted consolidation phase. A break above $4,000 might open the door for a short-term move toward $4,300 or higher if Ethereum can generate enough buying pressure.But it is important to consider the dangers of a brief retracement. In the event that Ethereum is unable to break $4,000 with conviction, the market may retreat to support levels of $3,700 or even $3,400. Additionally, the RSI's presence in the overbought area suggests that there may be a cooldown prior to a subsequent leg up.Ethereum's next rally phase will be determined in large part by on-chain metrics. Ethereum might reach $4,000, with the help of an increase in staking activity transactions or active addresses.  3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.Ethereum is still in a crucial stage right now. Even though the momentum of the rally has slowed around $4,000, the asset still has room to grow. At these levels, traders should keep a close eye out for any indications of weakness or a clear breakout to determine the next course of action.Solana remains calmSolana has broken out of its ongoing downward trend and pushed above the crucial $240 level, marking an important technical milestone. For investors who have been anxiously observing SOL's price action for indications of momentum and recovery, this represents a moment of hope. Even though this breakout is a clear sign of bullish intent, there may be a catch: the volume of trading is dropping.Solana's alignment above the major moving averages, such as the 50-100 and 200-day EMAs, supports its decisive crossing of the downtrend resistance line on the price chart. These indicators point to a continued upward trend and indicate that the overall trend is still bullish. The recent surge highlights buyer confidence and suggests that Solana may soon retest its prior highs. The decreasing volume that accompanies this breakout, however, raises questions regarding the move's strength. A breakout supported by rising volume usually indicates strong market activity and long-term viability. The declining volume in Solana's instance can be a sign of buyers waning interest or hesitancy, which might restrict future upside potential.A recovery in trading volume and activity is essential for Solana to solidify its breakout and clear the path for a move toward $260 and beyond. The strength of Solana's breakout should be evaluated by investors by keeping an eye on important support levels and looking for indications of growing market participation. 3rd party Ad.

This milestone, achieved 15 years after Bitcoin's creation, has sparked Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow to predict a future price target of $1 million. In his X post, Mow wrote that he will not remove \"laser eyes\" (a symbol of optimism and the future value of the flagship crypto in the BTC community) from his profile picture until Bitcoin reaches the $1 million level. The recent Bitcoin halving event, which has intensified scarcity by limiting the daily supply to approximately 450 units, supports this ambitious projection. Demand for Bitcoin is further bolstered by continuous acquisitions from companies such as MicroStrategy, which recently purchased 15,400 BTC, raising its total holdings to 402,100 BTC. Other companies, including Metaplanet and Semler Scientific (NASDAQ:SMLR), are also following suit, suggesting that the demand for Bitcoin could swell even further if major corporations like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) decide to enter the market.This article was originally published on U.TodayWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?With valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks.

Although mining balances have dropped since the April halving, this new drop signals stronger implications. Notably, it suggests that there is selling pressure, but that it is not linked to price movements.This movement of over 85,000 BTC is the highest since February 2024.

In most nations, people are not required to accept it as money, he noted. \"Transactions are slow and expensive, requiring significant computing power and energy to validate each one,\" Dudley stated.The ex-Fed president, however, believes that Bitcoin has some positive attributes: \"It\u2019s portable\u2014you can keep millions of dollars\u2019 worth on a thumb drive.

The elusive trifecta of scalable, cryptographically-secured and decentralized applications have been considered impossible, and a barrier to mass adoption \u2014 until now.A Breakthrough in Cryptography with No Trade-OffsBlockchains such as Ethereum have been hailed as the future of decentralized infrastructure, with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology heralded to enhance Ethereum's security and scalability beyond 120 TPS. According to the team, developing ZK proofs is complex and time-consuming, requiring thousands of hours across dozens of developers. Prioritizing speed in proof generation also means manually designing protocols, and with manual coding and tens of thousands of lines of code this introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This complicates the creation of security-sensitive decentralized applications and makes auditability and compliance a nightmare \u2013 all hindrances to widespread adoption in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare and AI.A team of Carnegie Mellon researchers is collaborating with Anaxi Labs to overcome this trade-offCMU\u2019s recent paper presents a revolutionary way to directly compile high-level software and convert it into simpler forms (low-level representations) needed for underlying proof systems to work. And all this is done automatically, repeatable and auditable, getting rid of the manual work, drastically improving performance while cryptographically ensuring security of the process. The work achieves this by analyzing the high-level program, breaking the program into small, indivisible units, then creating low-level representation from each unit that can be easily inputted into varieties of proof systems. 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.\u201cThis idea of breaking the computation into very specific chunks that take the place of a CPU in an automatic way is a new approach, and this is the first time that somebody has attempted this kind of approach where we avoid the full program representation for the compiler,\u201d said Riad Wahby, assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited about it.\u201dUnlocking New Decentralized ApplicationsThe research and the framework Anaxi Labs is building from the research are set to revolutionize industries in Web3 and beyond. In traditional and regulated finance, the performance boost while maintaining auditability enables real-time settlement of intrabank transfers like instant USD payments. In healthcare, amid challenges faced by 23andMe, secure and privacy-preserving encryption tools enabled by product being developed by Anaxi Labs, could now address critical concerns and safely utilize private genetic information by ensuring rightful ownership of one\u2019s DNA, while enabling valuable research. Within the realm of enterprise AI and critical physical infrastructures, a decentralized solution that requires high availability and close to zero latency such as rapid fine-tuning and inference across multiple data and compute power resources becomes a reality.In the immediate term, products based on the research provide the most effective solution for Web3 companies grappling with the scalability, security and decentralization trade-offs, offering a new design paradigm for rollups and interoperability.\u201cThis research and the product we are building incorporating the research will have profound implication to many important industry applications today that need a safe solution for their massive performance overheads, such as ZK and EVM, finally bringing us to the doorstep of our vision of cryptographically-secured decentralized consensus with real-time settlement,\u201d said Kate Shen, co-founder of Anaxi Labs.   3rd party Ad.

See disclosure here or remove ads.\u201cWe also like the fact that it is language and library agnostic, meaning a wide variety of projects can benefit from this without code modification. This enabled us to build an open, collaborative framework as opposed to the increasingly static, monolithic approaches today,\u201d Shen adds. \u201cThis enables all developers to automatically choose and combine the best of the latest advancements in proof systems such as lookups, co-processors and hardware acceleration; maximizing the performance gains of each computational substrate.\u201dAnaxi Labs and CyLab, a Game-Changing PartnershipCarnegie Mellon\u2019s CyLab has been at the center of cutting-edge research that\u2019s served as the foundation for blockchain development \u2013 including Zero-Knowledge. Notable faculty researchers from CyLab include esteemed professor Bryan Parno, a critical contributor to the history of ZK whose lab produced the widely cited Nova paper series, and assistant professor Riad Wahby, whose findings resulted in new cryptographic technologies that realized visions of the Ethereum Foundation (and more recently, the pathbreaking Jolt zkVM implementation by Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto division, a16z crypto).The findings set forth in this compiler framework are the result of the second research project originating from the symbiotic partnership between Anaxi Labs and CyLab through the CMU Secure Blockchain Initiative. This partnership enables CMU academics to collaborate and learn from the insights gleaned from the commercial deployments of their blockchain research, spearheaded by Anaxi Labs, for both Web3 and Web 2.0 applications. It enables them to find commercial solutions to major existing issues with blockchain that fails to bridge the gap between the known benefits of blockchain technology, and mass adoption. And it also serves as a springboard for CMU students to launch their careers in Web3. 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com.
